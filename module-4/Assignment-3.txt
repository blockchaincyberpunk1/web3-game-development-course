Integrating NFTs into a Game

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to integrate Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) into a game for asset ownership. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to incorporate NFT-based assets into the game logic, enabling players to own, use, and trade these assets within the game.

Instructions:

Introduction to NFT Integration:

Provide an introduction to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and their role in gaming, particularly in enhancing asset ownership and rarity.
Game Prototype and NFTs:

Share a simple game prototype with students (e.g., a 2D platformer) and a set of NFTs, such as characters or items.
Ensure students have access to the game's source code and a sample NFT smart contract for asset management.
NFT Integration:

Instruct students to integrate the provided NFTs into the game's logic.
Task them with implementing features that allow players to own, display, and interact with NFT-based assets within the game.
Encourage students to consider how NFT ownership enhances gameplay and how players can acquire NFTs (e.g., in-game achievements, purchases).
Inventory and Asset Display:

Require students to create an in-game inventory system that displays owned NFT assets.
Instruct them to design a user-friendly interface for viewing and managing NFTs.
Asset Utilization:

Task students with developing functionality for using NFT assets within the game. For example, if the NFTs represent characters, players should be able to select and use them.
Trading and Ownership:

Ensure that students implement secure methods for trading NFTs between players within the game.
Emphasize the importance of blockchain-based ownership and transfer mechanisms.
Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test and debug their integrated NFT features to ensure functionality and security.
Documentation:

Require students to create documentation that includes:
An explanation of how NFTs are integrated into the game.
A demonstration of how players can own, use, and trade NFT assets.
Screenshots or gameplay videos showcasing NFT integration.
Presentation and Peer Review:

Organize a presentation session where students can showcase their games with integrated NFT features.
Encourage peer reviews and discussions on the gameplay experience and the role of NFTs in the games.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful integration of NFTs into the game.
User-friendly inventory and asset display features.
Proper utilization and interaction with NFT-based assets.
Secure ownership and transfer of NFTs within the game.
Quality and completeness of documentation.
Quality of the presentation and participation in peer reviews.
