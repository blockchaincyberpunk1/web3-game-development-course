NFT Creation and Deployment

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to guide students in creating and deploying Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on a blockchain. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to create unique NFTs, deploy them using a smart contract, and understand the concept of NFT metadata.

Instructions:

Introduction to NFTs:

Provide an introduction to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and their use cases, with a focus on gaming and digital collectibles.
NFT Smart Contract Setup:

Share a simple NFT smart contract template, such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155, with students.
Instruct students to deploy this smart contract on a testnet of their choice (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten) using Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
Ensure that they have access to clear deployment instructions.
NFT Creation:

Task students with creating their unique NFTs. These NFTs can be digital art, collectible characters, or any other creative digital asset.
Encourage creativity in designing NFTs with unique properties.
Minting NFTs:

Instruct students to use the deployed smart contract to mint multiple instances of their NFTs.
Each NFT should have distinct properties or attributes, making them unique.
NFT Metadata:

Explain the concept of NFT metadata, which includes information such as images, descriptions, and other attributes associated with NFTs.
Require students to create metadata for their NFTs, including images and descriptions.
Deployment and Sharing:

Task students with deploying their NFTs using the smart contract they previously deployed.
Instruct them to share their NFTs on a blockchain explorer and provide the contract and token IDs for verification.
Documentation:

Require students to create documentation that includes:
A brief explanation of their NFT creation process.
Screenshots or links to their NFTs on a blockchain explorer.
Details about the NFT metadata they created.
Presentation and Peer Review:

Arrange for students to present their NFT creations to their peers or the class.
Encourage discussions on the uniqueness and creativity of each NFT.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful deployment of the NFT smart contract on a testnet.
Creativity and uniqueness of the NFTs created.
Proper minting of NFTs with distinct properties.
Quality and completeness of NFT metadata.
Documentation of the NFT creation process and sharing on a blockchain explorer.
Quality of the presentation and participation in peer reviews.
