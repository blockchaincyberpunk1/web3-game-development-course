Blockchain Asset Ownership

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to implement blockchain-based asset ownership in a game. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to integrate a smart contract into a game project (e.g., a virtual pet game) to represent in-game assets as blockchain tokens and implement features like asset transfers, breeding, or trading.

Instructions:

Introduction to Blockchain Asset Ownership:

Explain the concept of blockchain-based asset ownership and its significance in gaming.
Describe how blockchain technology ensures true ownership of in-game assets and their scarcity.
Game Project Selection:

Provide students with a basic game project template (e.g., a virtual pet game) that includes in-game assets (e.g., virtual pets).
Instruct students to choose this project as the basis for implementing blockchain-based asset ownership.
Smart Contract Integration:

Provide students with a basic smart contract template (e.g., an ERC-721 contract) for managing digital assets on the blockchain.
Task students with integrating the provided smart contract into their game project, ensuring that in-game assets are represented as blockchain tokens.
Instruct them to implement functionalities for asset transfers, breeding, or trading using the smart contract.
Asset Ownership Features:

Guide students in implementing key features related to asset ownership, which may include:
Transferring ownership of assets between players.
Implementing breeding mechanics, if applicable to the game concept.
Allowing asset trading among players.
User Guide Creation:

Instruct students to create a comprehensive user guide within their game project.
Require them to explain how blockchain-based asset ownership works in the game, including instructions for transferring, breeding, or trading assets.
Encourage clear and user-friendly documentation.
Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test the implemented features related to asset ownership.
Task them with debugging and resolving any issues that may arise during testing.
Gameplay Demonstration:

Require students to demonstrate the gameplay and asset ownership features within the game.
Encourage them to showcase how players can interact with and manage their blockchain-based assets.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful integration of the smart contract into the game.
Functionality and user-friendliness of the asset ownership features.
Clarity and completeness of the user guide.
Thoroughness of testing and debugging.
