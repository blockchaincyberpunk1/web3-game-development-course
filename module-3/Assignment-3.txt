Developing a Blockchain-Based Mini-Game

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to create a small blockchain-powered mini-game. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to develop a simple web-based mini-game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also integrating a smart contract for the game's functionality.

Instructions:

Introduction to Mini-Game Development:

Provide an overview of the importance of mini-games in the gaming industry.
Explain how blockchain technology can enhance mini-games by ensuring fairness, security, or ownership of in-game assets.
Mini-Game Concept Selection:

Instruct students to choose a concept for a web-based mini-game (e.g., a blockchain-based lottery, collectible game, or simple betting game).
Encourage them to think creatively and consider how blockchain features can be integrated into their chosen concept.
Smart Contract Integration:

Provide students with a basic smart contract template that suits the chosen game concept (e.g., an RNG-based contract for a lottery game or an ERC-721 contract for collectibles).
Task students with integrating the provided smart contract into their mini-game's backend using a Web3 library (e.g., web3.js or ethers.js).
Instruct them to implement functionalities such as generating random outcomes, managing collectibles, or handling player interactions with the smart contract.
User Interface Development:

Guide students in creating a user-friendly interface for the mini-game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Ensure that the interface allows players to interact with the game and the smart contract seamlessly.
Encourage them to design an appealing and intuitive interface.
Functionality Demonstration:

Require students to demonstrate how the mini-game works, including the blockchain-powered features.
Instruct them to showcase how players can participate, win, or collect blockchain-based assets within the game.
Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test their mini-game, paying special attention to blockchain interactions.
Task them with debugging and resolving any issues that arise during testing.
Documentation and User Guide:

Instruct students to provide documentation that explains the game's rules, blockchain integration, and how to play.
Encourage them to create a user guide that helps players understand the game's mechanics.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful integration of the smart contract into the mini-game.
Functionality and user-friendliness of the mini-game interface.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Thoroughness of testing and debugging.
