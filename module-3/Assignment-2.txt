Smart Contract Integration in Games

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to guide students in integrating smart contracts into a game's logic. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to integrate a provided smart contract into a game prototype, allowing for the creation and trade of in-game items as blockchain tokens.

Instructions:

Introduction to Smart Contract Integration:

Provide an overview of the benefits of integrating smart contracts into games, such as item ownership, secure trading, and player-driven economies.
Explain the basic concepts of smart contracts and how they interact with blockchain technology.
Game Prototype and Smart Contract:

Provide students with a simple game prototype or concept (e.g., a collectible card game) that includes the need for in-game items and trading.
Also, provide a basic smart contract (e.g., an ERC-721 token contract) for in-game item management. Ensure that students understand the contract's functionality.
Integration Task:

Task students with integrating the provided smart contract into the game prototype's logic.
Instruct them to implement the following functionalities:
Creating new in-game items as blockchain tokens when certain conditions are met.
Allowing players to own and trade these in-game items using the smart contract.
Updating the game's interface to reflect item ownership on the blockchain.
Demonstration:

Require students to demonstrate how the integrated smart contract interacts with the game's backend. This could involve creating and trading items within the game.
Code Comments or Documentation:

Instruct students to provide code comments or documentation explaining the integration process.
Encourage them to explain how the game's logic interacts with the smart contract and how blockchain transactions are initiated.
Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test the integration for correctness and potential vulnerabilities.
Task them with debugging and resolving any issues that arise during testing.
Presentation or Documentation:

Students can choose to present their integrated game and explain the smart contract integration to the class or submit comprehensive documentation.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful integration of the smart contract into the game.
Demonstration of in-game item creation and trading using blockchain tokens.
Clarity of code comments or documentation.
Thoroughness of testing and debugging.
