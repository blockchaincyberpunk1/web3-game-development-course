Decentralized Leaderboards

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to help students create decentralized leaderboards for competitive games. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to integrate a smart contract into a competitive game prototype, maintain a decentralized leaderboard, securely record scores on the blockchain, and display the leaderboard in the game.

Instructions:

Introduction to Decentralized Leaderboards:

Explain the concept of decentralized leaderboards in competitive games.
Describe how blockchain technology ensures transparency and security in recording and displaying scores.
Game Prototype Selection:

Provide students with a competitive game prototype (e.g., a blockchain-based quiz game) that includes a scoring mechanism.
Instruct students to choose this project as the basis for implementing decentralized leaderboards.
Smart Contract Integration:

Provide students with a basic smart contract template (e.g., Solidity) for recording and managing scores on the blockchain.
Task students with integrating the provided smart contract into their game prototype.
Ensure that the smart contract can securely record player scores on the blockchain.
Leaderboard Implementation:

Instruct students to implement a leaderboard system within the game that fetches and displays scores from the blockchain.
Task them with designing the leaderboard interface, which should showcase player usernames and their respective scores.
Encourage real-time updates of the leaderboard whenever a player achieves a new high score.
Blockchain Interaction:

Ensure that students use web3.js, ethers.js, or a similar library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain from within the game.
Guide them in developing functions that send score updates to the smart contract and retrieve leaderboard data.
User Testing and Security:

Encourage students to thoroughly test the leaderboard system within the game, ensuring that scores are accurately recorded and displayed.
Task them with addressing any potential security vulnerabilities in the smart contract or the game's interactions with it.
Documentation and User Guide:

Instruct students to create documentation for the leaderboard system, including how it functions and its security measures.
Require them to provide a user guide that explains how players can view the leaderboard and how scores are recorded on the blockchain.
Leaderboard Demonstration:

Ask students to demonstrate the game's functionality, including playing the game, achieving high scores, and viewing the decentralized leaderboard.
Encourage them to showcase the real-time updating of the leaderboard.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful integration of the smart contract into the game.
Functionality and user-friendliness of the leaderboard system.
Security measures implemented in the smart contract and game.
Clarity and completeness of the documentation and user guide.
Effective demonstration of the game's leaderboard functionality.
