Designing a Blockchain-Powered Game

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to encourage students to design a concept for a blockchain-powered game, considering the integration of decentralized features. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to brainstorm and outline a game concept that leverages blockchain technology, highlighting how blockchain enhances gameplay or ownership.

Instructions:

Introduction to Blockchain-Powered Games:

Provide an overview of blockchain technology and its potential applications in the gaming industry.
Explain the benefits of blockchain in gaming, such as ownership of in-game assets, transparency, and player-driven economies.
Brainstorming and Conceptualization:

Instruct students to brainstorm and design a concept for a blockchain-powered game. Encourage them to think creatively about how blockchain can be integrated into the game mechanics.
Emphasize the importance of considering decentralized features that leverage blockchain's unique capabilities.
Game Concept Outline:

Task students with outlining the following aspects of their game concept:
Game Genre: Specify the genre of the game (e.g., RPG, collectible card game, virtual world).
Gameplay Mechanics: Describe the core gameplay mechanics and interactions that make the game engaging.
Blockchain Integration: Explain how blockchain technology will be integrated into the game. Consider aspects such as ownership of in-game assets as NFTs, player-driven economies, or provably rare items.
Decentralized Features: Highlight the decentralized features that enhance the gaming experience. This could include transparent item ownership, cross-game interoperability, or player-driven governance.
Game Design Document (GDD):

Require students to create a visual or written game design document (GDD) that encompasses the game concept and blockchain integration details.
The GDD should include diagrams, sketches, or flowcharts to visualize the game's mechanics and interactions.
Encourage students to use clear and concise language to articulate their ideas.
Blockchain Use Cases:

Ask students to specify the blockchain they would use for their game (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain) and justify their choice.
Explore potential smart contract functionalities that would enhance the gameplay experience.
Presentation or Documentation:

Students can choose to present their game concepts to the class or submit their written GDD.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Creativity and innovation in the game concept.
Clarity and completeness of the GDD.
Demonstrated understanding of how blockchain technology enhances the game.
Justification of the chosen blockchain and smart contract functionalities.
