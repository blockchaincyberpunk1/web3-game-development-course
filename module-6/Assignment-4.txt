Play-to-Earn Mechanism

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to design and implement a play-to-earn mechanism in a web-based game. This assignment provides students with the opportunity to explore the concept of blockchain-based rewards and cryptocurrency tokens in gaming.

Instructions:

Introduction to Play-to-Earn Mechanism:

Provide an introduction to the play-to-earn concept, explaining how players can earn cryptocurrency tokens by achieving specific in-game goals.
Discuss the potential benefits and challenges of integrating a play-to-earn mechanism in games.
Selecting a Game Framework or Engine:

Instruct students to select a game framework or engine suitable for web-based game development.
Ensure that the chosen framework supports web integration and cryptocurrency wallet integration.
Game Development and Play-to-Earn Implementation:

Task students with developing a web-based game that incorporates a play-to-earn mechanism.
Guide them in designing specific in-game goals or achievements that, when completed, allow players to earn cryptocurrency tokens.
Encourage creativity in defining the gameplay mechanics and goals.
Cryptocurrency Wallet Integration:

Teach students how to integrate cryptocurrency wallet functionality into the game.
Instruct them to choose a cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum) and implement secure wallet integration that allows players to store, manage, and withdraw earned tokens.
Designing Play-to-Earn Rules and Rewards:

Require students to design and document the rules and reward structure for the play-to-earn mechanism.
Specify how players can earn tokens, the conversion rate from in-game achievements to tokens, and any limitations or conditions.
Testing and Debugging:

Task students with rigorous testing of the game's play-to-earn mechanism.
Encourage them to simulate various player scenarios and ensure that token rewards are correctly distributed.
Documentation and Reporting:

Require students to create a comprehensive report that includes:
Descriptions of the game's play-to-earn features.
Explanations of the cryptocurrency wallet integration.
Details of the play-to-earn rules and reward structure.
Documentation of the testing process and bug fixes.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
The effectiveness of the play-to-earn mechanism in enhancing player engagement.
The successful integration of cryptocurrency wallet functionality.
The clarity and completeness of documentation and reporting.
Demonstrated understanding of play-to-earn concepts and cryptocurrency integration in gaming.
