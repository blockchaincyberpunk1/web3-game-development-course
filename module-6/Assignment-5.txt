UX Testing and Optimization

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to conduct user experience (UX) testing and optimize web-based games. Students will work on identifying UX issues, gathering user feedback, and making iterative improvements to enhance the overall player experience.

Instructions:

Introduction to UX Testing:

Provide an introduction to the importance of user experience (UX) in game development.
Explain the significance of player feedback and continuous improvement in creating engaging games.
Selecting a Game with Known Issues:

Provide students with a web-based game that has known UX issues. The game should include performance bottlenecks, confusing user interfaces, or other issues.
Instruct students to thoroughly explore and play the game to understand the existing problems.
Identifying UX Issues:

Task students with identifying and documenting UX issues they encounter while playing the game.
Encourage them to take notes on usability problems, performance bottlenecks, and any other factors that negatively impact the player experience.
Playtesting and Gathering User Feedback:

Instruct students to conduct playtesting sessions with real users, such as classmates, friends, or volunteers.
Require them to collect user feedback regarding their experiences while playing the game.
Students should document feedback on usability, user interface, and overall enjoyment.
Iterative Improvements:

Guide students in making iterative improvements to the game based on the UX issues identified and user feedback received.
Encourage them to implement changes that address the documented problems.
Performance Optimization:

Teach students how to optimize game performance to ensure smooth gameplay.
Provide guidance on optimizing code, assets, and any other elements affecting performance.
Testing and Validation:

Task students with testing the game after implementing improvements and optimizations.
Ensure that they validate the changes by checking if the identified UX issues have been resolved.
Documentation and Reporting:

Require students to create a comprehensive report that includes:
An overview of the identified UX issues.
Details of the user feedback received.
Descriptions of the iterative improvements made.
Documentation of performance optimization efforts.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Effectiveness in identifying and addressing UX issues.
Quality of user feedback collection and analysis.
Demonstrated ability to make iterative improvements.
Successful game performance optimization.
Clarity and completeness of documentation and reporting.
