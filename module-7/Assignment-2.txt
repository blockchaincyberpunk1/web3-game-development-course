Transaction Security

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to guide students in implementing secure transactions within a Web3 game. Students will learn how to enhance the security of in-game purchases and trades, handle error scenarios, and ensure the tamper-proof nature of transactions on a blockchain platform like Ethereum.

Instructions:

Introduction to Transaction Security:

Provide an introduction to transaction security within the context of Web3 game development.
Explain the importance of secure transactions for in-game purchases and trades.
Blockchain Platform Introduction:

Introduce students to a specific blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum) and provide relevant SDKs or libraries for blockchain interaction.
Enhancing an Existing Web3 Game:

Instruct students to select an existing Web3 game (could be a game they developed in a previous assignment or a provided template).
Task them with enhancing the game by implementing secure transactions for in-game purchases or trades. These transactions can involve in-game currency or assets represented as tokens on the blockchain.
Secure Transaction Implementation:

Guide students in implementing secure transaction handling within the game. They should:
Use the provided blockchain SDKs to facilitate transactions.
Ensure that transactions are validated and executed securely.
Implement mechanisms to handle error scenarios, including failed transactions.
Guarantee the tamper-proof nature of transactions by utilizing blockchain features.
Unit Testing for Transaction Security:

Require students to write unit tests to validate the security of their transaction system. Unit tests should cover various scenarios, including successful transactions, failed transactions, and potential attack vectors.
Documentation and Reporting:

Instruct students to document their secure transaction implementation thoroughly. Their documentation should include:
Details of how transactions are implemented within the game.
Steps taken to ensure security, error handling, and tamper resistance.
Unit test descriptions, code snippets, and results.
Testing and Evaluation:

Task students with testing the secure transaction system by simulating different in-game transaction scenarios.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
The effectiveness and security of their transaction implementation.
The completeness and correctness of their unit tests.
The quality of their documentation and reporting.
Their ability to secure in-game transactions and handle potential issues.
