Player Data Encryption

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to implement data encryption and decryption mechanisms to secure player data in a Web3 game. Students will learn the importance of protecting sensitive information and implementing cryptographic techniques for data security.

Instructions:

Introduction to Data Encryption:

Provide an introduction to data encryption and its significance in web-based game development.
Explain the importance of securing player data to protect sensitive information.
Providing a Simple Web3 Game:

Offer a simple web-based game that collects and stores player data. The game should include elements like user registration, login, and personal information.
Data Encryption Implementation:

Instruct students to implement data encryption and decryption mechanisms using cryptographic libraries or tools. You can suggest using JavaScript libraries like CryptoJS or WebCrypto API.
Task them with identifying sensitive player data that needs to be protected, such as login credentials or personal details.
Encryption of Sensitive Data:

Require students to implement encryption for the identified sensitive data within the game. This should include encrypting data before it's stored and decrypting it when needed for legitimate purposes.
Documentation of Encryption Approach:

Instruct students to document their encryption approach comprehensively. Their documentation should include:
Details of the cryptographic techniques or libraries used.
An explanation of how sensitive data is encrypted and decrypted within the game.
Examples or code snippets demonstrating the encryption process.
Insights into how encryption enhances data security in the game.
Testing Data Security:

Task students with testing the security of their game by attempting to access sensitive data without authorization. They should ensure that encrypted data remains protected.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
The effectiveness of their data encryption and decryption implementation.
The security of sensitive player data within the game.
The clarity and completeness of their documentation.
Their ability to protect player data from unauthorized access.
