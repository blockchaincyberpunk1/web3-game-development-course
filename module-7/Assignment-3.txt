Security Auditing

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to perform a security audit on a Web3 game. Students will learn how to identify, document, and propose fixes for security vulnerabilities in a game. They will prioritize security issues based on potential impact and exploitability.

Instructions:

Introduction to Security Auditing:

Provide an introduction to the importance of security auditing in Web3 game development.
Explain the potential risks associated with security vulnerabilities in games.
Providing the Web3 Game:

Provide students with access to a Web3 game that contains known or simulated vulnerabilities.
Ensure that the game exhibits various types of security weaknesses, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, data exposure, or user authentication issues.
Conducting a Security Audit:

Instruct students to conduct a thorough security audit of the provided Web3 game.
Task them with identifying and documenting security weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and potential attack vectors.
Encourage students to use appropriate tools, methodologies, and best practices for security auditing.
Documentation of Vulnerabilities:

Require students to document each identified security vulnerability, including:
A description of the vulnerability.
Its potential impact on the game and users.
The steps to reproduce or exploit the vulnerability.
Suggestions for mitigation or fixes.
Proposing Fixes and Improvements:

Task students with proposing fixes or improvements to address the identified vulnerabilities. These fixes may include code changes, configuration adjustments, or architectural enhancements.
Prioritizing Security Issues:

Instruct students to prioritize the security issues based on:
Their potential impact on the game.
The likelihood of exploitation.
The ease of fixing or mitigating the issue.
Reporting and Recommendations:

Require students to create a comprehensive security audit report. The report should include:
An executive summary.
A list of identified vulnerabilities with detailed descriptions.
Prioritization of vulnerabilities.
Proposed fixes or improvements for each vulnerability.
Recommendations for ongoing security monitoring and maintenance.
Presentation and Discussion:

Organize a presentation session where students can share their findings and recommendations.
Encourage discussion and peer feedback on the security audit reports.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
The thoroughness of their security audit.
The accuracy and clarity of vulnerability documentation.
The effectiveness of proposed fixes and improvements.
The quality of the security audit report and recommendations.
