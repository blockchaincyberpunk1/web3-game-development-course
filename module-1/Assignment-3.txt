Game Engine Exploration

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to a specific game engine or framework commonly used in game development. By exploring the documentation, tutorials, and creating a simple interactive project, students will gain hands-on experience with a tool that can be valuable in web3 game development.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Explain the significance of understanding and working with game engines or frameworks in modern game development.
Emphasize that game engines provide a structured environment for creating interactive experiences.
Choosing a Game Engine or Framework:

Provide a list of game engines or frameworks from which students can choose. Examples include:
Unity
Phaser
Three.js
Unreal Engine
Godot Engine
Encourage students to select one that aligns with their interests and goals.
Exploration and Learning:

Task students with exploring the chosen game engine or framework's official documentation and available tutorials.
Instruct them to gain a basic understanding of the engine's features, capabilities, and workflow.
Project Development:

Challenge students to create a simple interactive game or animation project using the selected engine or framework.
Specify that the project should include elements such as character movement, object interaction, or visual effects, depending on the capabilities of the chosen tool.
Encourage creativity and experimentation within the project.
Project Submission:

Require students to submit the following project components:
All project files and assets.
A brief documentation file that explains the project's concept and features.
A reflection on their experience, including any challenges faced and how they were addressed.
Peer Review and Showcase:

Organize a session where students can showcase their projects to the class.
Encourage peer review and feedback on the functionality, creativity, and overall quality of the projects.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
The successful creation of an interactive project using the chosen engine or framework.
The quality of the project in terms of functionality and user experience.
The clarity of project documentation and the depth of reflection on the experience.
Reflection and Improvement:

Prompt students to reflect on their experiences with the chosen engine or framework.
Ask them to consider how they could further enhance their projects or explore more advanced features.
Note: This assignment provides students with practical experience in working with a game engine or framework. It allows them to explore a tool that can be beneficial in web3 game development and fosters creativity in designing interactive experiences.
