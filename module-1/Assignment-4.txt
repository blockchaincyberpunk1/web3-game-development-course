Game Design Principles

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to essential game design principles and emphasize their significance in web3 game development. By selecting and applying a specific principle, students will gain insights into the fundamental elements that make games engaging and enjoyable.

Instructions:

Introduction to Game Design Principles:

Explain the importance of game design principles in creating compelling and engaging games.
Present a set of game design principles, such as player engagement, pacing, user feedback, aesthetics, and narrative.
Selection of Game Design Principle:

Instruct students to choose one game design principle from the provided list.
Encourage students to select a principle that aligns with their interests or the type of game they aspire to create.
Research and Understanding:

Task students with conducting research on the selected game design principle.
Instruct them to explore case studies or examples of games that successfully apply this principle.
Require students to write a brief summary of their research findings.
Game Concept Design:

Challenge students to design a web3 game concept that incorporates the chosen game design principle.
Instruct them to outline the game's core mechanics, objectives, and how the chosen principle will enhance the player's experience.
Encourage creativity and innovation in their game concepts.
Design Document Creation:
