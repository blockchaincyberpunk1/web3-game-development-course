Basic Game Mechanics Implementation

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to the fundamental concept of implementing game mechanics using a programming language. By choosing a simple game mechanic and creating a functional game prototype, students will gain hands-on experience in translating game ideas into code.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Explain the importance of understanding and implementing game mechanics in game development.
Emphasize that game mechanics are the core interactive elements that drive player engagement and gameplay experiences.
Choosing a Game Mechanic:

Provide a list of simple game mechanics from which students can choose. Examples include:
Character movement (e.g., player character navigation)
Object interaction (e.g., collecting items)
Collision detection (e.g., detecting when objects collide)
Encourage students to select a game mechanic that aligns with their interests and goals.
Programming Language Selection:

Allow students to choose a programming language of their choice for implementing the selected game mechanic. Suggested languages include JavaScript, Python, or any language commonly used for game development.
Implementation Task:

Instruct students to implement the chosen game mechanic using their selected programming language.
Task them with creating a simple game prototype that showcases the game mechanic in action.
Encourage students to consider factors such as user input, feedback, and interaction within their prototype.
Code Documentation:

Require students to provide thorough documentation for their code. This documentation should explain:
How the game mechanic was implemented in code.
Key functions, variables, and logic used in the implementation.
Any challenges faced during the coding process and how they were addressed.
Prototype Demonstration:

Instruct students to demonstrate their game prototype to the class or submit a video recording of the gameplay.
Encourage them to provide a brief overview of the prototype's purpose and how the chosen game mechanic enhances the gameplay experience.
Peer Review and Feedback:

Organize a peer review session where students can playtest each other's game prototypes.
Encourage constructive feedback on the functionality and user experience of the prototypes.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Correct implementation of the chosen game mechanic.
Code quality, readability, and organization.
The functionality and usability of the game prototype.
The clarity and completeness of code documentation.
Reflection and Improvement:

Encourage students to reflect on their experiences during the implementation process.
Ask them to consider how they could further enhance their game mechanic or prototype if they had more time or resources.
