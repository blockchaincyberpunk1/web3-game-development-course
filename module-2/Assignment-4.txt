Smart Contract Integration

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to integrate a custom Ethereum smart contract into a game or application. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to create and deploy a simple smart contract and integrate it into their project to represent in-game items or assets as blockchain tokens.

Instructions:

Introduction to Smart Contract Integration:

Explain the importance of integrating smart contracts into games or applications in the context of Web3 game development.
Provide an overview of the project template (e.g., Unity game or web app) that students will be using.
Choose a Project Template:

Instruct students to choose one of the following project templates for integration:
Unity game (for 3D/2D games).
Web application (for browser-based games or applications).
Any other project template that they are comfortable with.
Smart Contract Development:

Task students with creating a simple Ethereum smart contract using Solidity.
The contract should represent collectible items or assets (e.g., game characters, items, tokens).
Guide them through deploying the contract to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Ropsten).
Integration Implementation:

Instruct students to integrate the smart contract into their chosen project template.
Explain that this integration should allow the in-game items or assets to be represented as blockchain tokens.
Interactions and Functionality:

Task students with implementing interactions between the game or application and the smart contract.
For example, they should be able to mint new tokens, transfer tokens between users, or query token ownership.
Encourage them to consider how the smart contract enhances gameplay or functionality.
Demonstration:

Require students to demonstrate how their integrated project works.
They should showcase interactions with the smart contract within the game or application.
Encourage them to create a video demonstration or a live presentation.
Documentation:

Instruct students to provide documentation explaining how the smart contract integration works.
This should include a description of the contract's functionality, how it was integrated, and how users can interact with it.
Code Documentation:

Ask students to document their code to make it understandable and maintainable.
Encourage them to include comments and explanations of key functions and sections.
Testing:

Instruct students to thoroughly test their integrated project to ensure that it functions correctly.
Encourage them to use a local Ethereum development environment (e.g., Ganache) for testing.
Submission:

Require students to submit their integrated project code, documentation, and a video demonstration (if applicable).
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful integration of the smart contract into the chosen project template.
Functionality and usability of the integrated project.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Quality of code documentation.
Thoroughness of testing.
