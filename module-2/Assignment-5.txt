Ethereum Transaction Analysis

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with the analysis of Ethereum transactions and blockchain explorers. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to navigate an Ethereum blockchain explorer, select and analyze a random Ethereum transaction, and understand the importance of transparency and visibility in blockchain transactions.

Instructions:

Introduction to Ethereum Transaction Analysis:

Explain the importance of transaction analysis in the context of Web3 game development.
Emphasize the role of transparency and visibility in blockchain transactions.
Selecting a Blockchain Explorer:

Instruct students to choose an Ethereum blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherscan, Etherchain) to perform their transaction analysis.
Provide resources and guidance on how to use the selected blockchain explorer effectively.
Random Ethereum Transaction Selection:

Task students with selecting a random Ethereum transaction from the blockchain explorer's transaction list.
