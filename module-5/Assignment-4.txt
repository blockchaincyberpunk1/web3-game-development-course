Decentralized Server Integration in Multiplayer Games

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to integrate decentralized servers for multiplayer interactions in a blockchain-based environment. By completing this assignment, students will learn how to adapt a multiplayer game prototype for decentralized server hosting using a blockchain platform.

Instructions:

Introduction to Decentralized Server Integration:

Provide an introduction to the concept of decentralized server integration in multiplayer games.
Explain the benefits of using blockchain technology for hosting game servers, such as transparency and decentralization.
Selection of Blockchain Platform:

Introduce students to a blockchain platform suitable for decentralized server hosting (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or a blockchain platform of your choice).
Instruct students to choose a blockchain platform for their project.
Adapting the Multiplayer Game:

Provide a multiplayer game prototype or a basic multiplayer game concept.
Task students with adapting the game to integrate decentralized servers.
Instruct them to define the server-side logic as smart contracts on the chosen blockchain platform.
Server-Client Interaction:

Guide students in connecting the game clients to the decentralized server for multiplayer interactions.
Ensure that students implement communication protocols between the game clients and the blockchain-based server.
Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test their multiplayer game with decentralized server integration.
Task them with debugging any issues related to server-client interactions and blockchain transactions.
Documentation:

Require students to create comprehensive documentation that includes:
Detailed explanations of the decentralized server integration.
Instructions for testing the multiplayer game with decentralized servers.
Troubleshooting tips for server-client interactions.
Presentation and Playtesting:

Organize a presentation session where students can demonstrate their multiplayer games with decentralized server integration.
Facilitate playtesting sessions among students to gather feedback and assess gameplay experiences.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful integration of decentralized servers for multiplayer interactions.
Functionality and stability of the multiplayer game with blockchain-based servers.
Quality and completeness of documentation.
Quality of the presentation and participation in playtesting sessions.
