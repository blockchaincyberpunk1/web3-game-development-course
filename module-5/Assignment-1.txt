Simple Multiplayer Game Prototype

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to create a basic multiplayer game prototype. By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in developing multiplayer game features using a suitable game engine or framework.

Instructions:

Introduction to Multiplayer Game Development:

Provide an introduction to the concept of multiplayer game development.
Explain the importance of synchronization, networking, and real-time interactions in multiplayer games.
Selecting the Game Engine or Framework:

Offer a choice of game engines or frameworks suitable for multiplayer development (e.g., Unity with Photon, Godot with ENet).
Ensure that students have access to necessary resources and documentation for their chosen platform.
Game Concept Selection:

Allow students to select a simple multiplayer game concept (e.g., real-time strategy, multiplayer shooter).
Encourage creativity but emphasize simplicity, as this is a prototype.
Development of Multiplayer Features:

Task students with implementing basic multiplayer features in their game prototype. This may include:
Player movement and control.
Interactions between players (e.g., shooting, trading, or collaboration).
Real-time synchronization of game elements.
Local Server Setup:

Instruct students to set up a local server environment for testing the multiplayer game.
Provide guidance on hosting the game on a local server to enable multiplayer testing.
Testing and Debugging:

Encourage thorough testing to ensure that multiplayer interactions work as expected.
Instruct students to identify and debug issues related to synchronization and networking.
Documentation:

Require students to create documentation that includes:
An overview of the game concept and objectives.
Descriptions of implemented multiplayer features.
Instructions for testing the game on a local server.
Presentation and Peer Feedback:

Organize a presentation session where students can showcase their multiplayer game prototypes.
Encourage peer reviews and discussions on the gameplay experience and any improvements that can be made.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful implementation of basic multiplayer features.
Functionality and playability of the multiplayer prototype.
Quality and completeness of documentation.
Quality of the presentation and participation in peer reviews.
