Peer-to-Peer Multiplayer Game Development

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to guide students in creating a peer-to-peer multiplayer game using a game engine or framework with peer-to-peer networking capabilities. By completing this assignment, students will gain practical experience in implementing real-time, direct player-to-player interactions in a multiplayer game.

Instructions:

Introduction to Peer-to-Peer Networking:

Provide an introduction to the concept of peer-to-peer networking in multiplayer games.
Explain the benefits of peer-to-peer networking, such as reduced latency and direct player interactions.
Selection of Game Engine/Framework:

Offer a choice of game engines or frameworks with peer-to-peer networking capabilities (e.g., Unity with UNET, Godot with WebRTC).
Instruct students to choose one for their multiplayer game development.
Game Concept and Design:

Task students with brainstorming and designing a peer-to-peer multiplayer game concept. Examples include card games, real-time chat applications, or simple collaborative experiences.
Require them to create a game design document (GDD) outlining the game's mechanics, objectives, and player interactions.
Peer-to-Peer Implementation:

Instruct students to implement the chosen game concept using the selected game engine or framework.
Guide them in establishing direct connections between players for real-time interactions.
Ensure that students handle data synchronization and manage network issues effectively.
Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test their peer-to-peer multiplayer game.
Task them with debugging network-related issues and ensuring smooth gameplay experiences.
Documentation:

Require students to create comprehensive documentation that includes:
A detailed explanation of the peer-to-peer networking implementation.
Instructions for testing the multiplayer game.
Troubleshooting tips for network-related problems.
Presentation and Playtesting:

Organize a presentation session where students can showcase their peer-to-peer multiplayer games.
Facilitate playtesting sessions among students to gather feedback and assess gameplay experiences.
Assessment Criteria:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:
Successful implementation of peer-to-peer networking for multiplayer gameplay.
Functionality and stability of the multiplayer game.
Quality and completeness of documentation.
Quality of the presentation and participation in playtesting sessions.
